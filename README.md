üìà Sharpe Ratio Maximization
Welcome to my Sharpe Ratio Maximization project! This repository explores portfolio optimization techniques to maximize the Sharpe ratio, a fundamental metric for evaluating risk-adjusted returns in finance.

üåü Overview
The Sharpe ratio is a widely used financial metric that helps investors measure the performance of an investment relative to its risk. This project dives into:

Optimizing portfolio weights to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns.
Exploring risk management techniques to ensure portfolio stability.
Leveraging Python libraries to analyze financial data and implement optimization algorithms.

üõ† Key Features
1Ô∏è‚É£ Portfolio Optimization
Dynamic allocation of portfolio weights to maximize the Sharpe ratio.
Incorporation of constraints such as diversification and correlation to align with real-world investment scenarios.

2Ô∏è‚É£Data Analysis
Use of historical asset price data to calculate key metrics such as returns, volatility, and correlation.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about the assets in the portfolio.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimization Techniques
Application of numerical optimization methods with SciPy‚Äôs minimize function to solve for portfolio weights.
Comparison of optimized portfolios against naive equal-weight strategies.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Risk Management
Metrics like portfolio volatility and maximum drawdown to evaluate risk.
Trade-off analysis between return and risk.

üìä Visualization
Visualized portfolio performance using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Plotted efficient frontiers to illustrate the relationship between risk and return.
